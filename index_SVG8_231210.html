            <h1>What Does One Billion Dollars Look Like?</h1>
                
                <p>We hear the number $1billion bandied about. But who can really conceive of that number, let alone what that means in terms of private wealth.</p> 
                
                <p>Let's try to figure it out, first by looking at scale.</p>
                
                <p>This is one pixel. Can you see it?</p>

                <div class = "svg-container" id = "svg-container-1"></div>

                <p>Here's 1,000 pixels:</p>

                <div class = "svg-container" id = "svg-container-2"></div>

                <p>This is 1,000,000 pixels:</p>
                
                <div class = "svg-container" id = "svg-container-3"></div>

                <p>Getting pretty big! You probably had to scroll a bit to see it all. 
                    Well get ready for more scrolling, because this is what 1,000,000,000 pixels looks like: </p>

                <div id="tooltip-svg4" class="tooltip-container"></div>
                <div id="trigger-point"></div>
                <div class = "svg-container" id = "svg-container-4"></div>

                <p>Dollars are also abstract. In a sense, money itself represents some sort of collective social 
                    value. It both allows you to buy things and is a measure of collective effort. 
                    Some of the numbers above reference money. For instance the yearly budget of St. Louis, 
                    Missouri is about $1billion. That sum is collected in taxes and fees from the people living
                     and doing business there. That's an example of public wealth, subject to democratic 
                     oversight and deployment.</p> 

                <p>On the other hand the U.S. is now estimated to be home to XXX billionaires and 
                    growing. That means XXX Americans privately own at least one billion dollars.</p> 
                    
                <p>Here's a rough breakdown of what St. Louis spends $1billion on annually.</p>

                <div class = "svg-container" id = "svg-container-5"></div>
                <div id="tooltip-svg5" class="tooltip-container"></div>
                
                <p>These represent the needs of a whole City. But what are the needs of an average American?</p>

                <div class = "svg-container" id = "svg-container-6"></div>
                <div id="tooltip-svg6" class="tooltip-container"></div>

                <p>The average American household spent $87,432 in 2021.</p>
                
                <div class = "svg-container" id = "svg-container-7"></div>
                <div id="tooltip-svg7-yearlyhouseholdexpenses" class="tooltip-container"></div>
                <div id="tooltip-svg7-yearlymunicipalexpenses" class="tooltip-container"></div>

                <p>The two values are barely comprable! Now think about that in terms of 
                    individual buying power.</p>
                
                <p>One single person with one billion dollars could cover the annual costs of 11,437 
                    average American households! 
                </p>

                <div id="tooltip-svg8-firstrectangle" class="tooltip-container"></div>
                <div id="tooltip-svg8-lastrectangle" class="tooltip-container"></div>
