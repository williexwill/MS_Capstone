# Building the Website

11/16/23
My plan is to work with ChatGPT to help me build out an interactive website using d3.js along with data that I will provide...

I have multiple interactive visualizations I hope to incorporate. For now I am going to focus on the first visualization: I want to create a scrolly-telling, flexible box of 1 billion pixels, with specific pixels highlighted and with pop out captions. I have a spreadsheet ready with basci info to start playing with. 

I am going to begin with some basic html and stlye pulled from some previous projects.
